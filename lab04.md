ITMD 362 Lab 4: Color Palettes

For this lab, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com. Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette. You’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make. Write 2 sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did. Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Create a Basecamp post "Lab-4: your name" and simply post the following as plain text.

    An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=54u0F0kyEqLL5l6L6l7o5v5EJPn

Your Rationale: The most distinct console colors are red, blue, and green and while some regular colors seen are black and white, I think that having a midnight blue as the main color of the console sets it apart. The purple can be the highlight of when its on and the dark pink are smaller decals around the console.
    
    A triadic color palette for announcing Chicago Botanical Gardens springtime tours.

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33k0x0kotPKlAZLgVYluPGqwpWV

Your Rationale: Outside of its greenery and trees, I wanted to show the blooming of red and yellow tulips on a cloudless blue sky. With so many unique colors to choose from I think its easy to forget about the classic colors that are a classic to the botanical garden.  

    A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=54k0u0ktcs4tqKSngFOuRjqGxrJ

Your Rationale: A lot of private messaging apps go for a dark or light blue color scheme. I wanted to keep the dark aspect but add a purple to represent strength and the power of having protected messages. 

    A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0ktcs4tqKSngFOuRjqGxrJ

Your Rationale: Since the image for ruby on rails is a strong red/ruby I decided to select the strongest red I could get to without bordering on orange.
